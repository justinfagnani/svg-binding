svg-binding
===========

Examples of Interactive Graphics using SVG and template binding

It turns out that you can now use template binding with SVG elements. This is
great news for fans of d3, Ractive.js, Triangular, etc. Templating and
data-binding are only a fraction of the functionality of d3, but they are an
important foundation.

The examples aren't hosted anywhere, but if you clone the project and run the
html files in web/ you can see them in action.
